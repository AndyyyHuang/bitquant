## Introduction

BitQuant is a subnet for quantitative trading miners need to provide their factor-based signal (long/short) and 
validators evaluate the performance based on the portfolio returns constructed by their signal.
Based on portfolio metrics such as omega score and total portfolio return, weights/incentive get set to reward the best miners.

We provide factor mining framework, factor combination methodology, and backtesting system for miners to 
construct their factor-based trading strategies. If you don't have any mature strategy yet, highly recommend you to refer to these 
well-designed framework we provided which will help you construct your own strategy from zero. 

Have fun!
